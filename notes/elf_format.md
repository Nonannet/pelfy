The computation that must be performed in order to determine the relocation result. The following
nomenclature is used
- S denotes the value of symbol referenced in ELF32_R_SYM component of the r_info field.
- A denotes the initial addend. For a RELA type relocation the value is used unmodified. For a REL type
relocation the value must be extracted from the place in a manner that is determined by the type of the
place.
- P denotes the address of the place being relocated. It is the sum of the r_offset field and the base
address of the section being relocated (note that all relocations involving P are of the form S â€“ P, where
the symbol referenced is in the same consolidated output section as P, so it is not necessary to know the
absolute address of the section being relocated).

- B is the nominal base address used for accessing objects in the read-write data areas.
- E is the nominal base address used for accessing objects in the executable and read-only areas.
The precise definition of a nominal base address is platform defined, but it must be possible for the application to
retrieve the value at run time by one of the following methods:
! A pre-determined value
! A value in a known register
! A suitable symbol
! A library call
The platform documentation must describe the appropriate model for each of B and E (they need not be the
same).
